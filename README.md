# CatWiki

This is a basic template to get you started with the CatWiki challenge.
It contains a frontend and a backend, with some very basic interaction
between them. Feel free to modify whatever you wish, or to start
completely from scratch! :smiley_cat:

## Starting the app

Open a new tab, and run the following commands in your terminal:

```
npm run dev
```

This should open up a new page in your default web browser at `localhost:3000`.
At this point, you should see the placeholder CatWiki app homepage.
